Gesture Recognition
===================

Kinect v1 Gesture Recognition application based on OpenNI 2.2, OpenCV 2.4.11 with Qt 4.8.6. This is a group project. <br>
The contributors are: Zhou hanyue, Yu Bowen, Hou Yuechao, Lv dongqing and  Yang Haoze <br>

Goal
-----
The Goal of the project is to design the application for Windows to detect users' gestures based on Kinect Sensor v1. <br>
We implemented five kinds of guestures form number 0 to number 5. <br> 

Feature
-------
* 1. Implemented image segmentation algorithm 
* 2. Implemented image noise filtering to increase the accuracy 
* 3. Used OpenCV to draw the feature points to judge the gestures 
* 4. Easy to extend 

Way to Use
-------
You can directly use the exe file built before [here](https://github.com/yuechaohou/Gesture/tree/master/GestureRecognition/Win32/Release)
, or you can rebuild the project by your self.

* 1. Make use you install OpenNI 2.2, OpenCV 2.4.11 and Qt 4.8.6 correctly 
* 2. Connect to Kinect 1.0 with USB, and ensure the indicator light on the Kinect glows green
* 3. Runt the application
